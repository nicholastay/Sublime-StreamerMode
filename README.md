# Sublime-StreamerMode (for Sublime Text **3**)

*(I apologize in advance for the cringey sellout message)*

Do you stream programming and worried/have accidentally opened config files or the like with confidential data? Well, this plugin is the plugin for you.

## Install
```
$ cd /Users/nicholastay/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages # or where your packages are
$ git clone https://github.com/nicholastay/Sublime-StreamerMode.git

# Now open Sublime Text and open the Command Palette and use 'Streamer Mode: Toggle'
# Open your Preferences (User) and add glob patterns to the hide list - access to those files will be hidden while streamer mode is active
# Toggle streamer mode with that Command Palette option
# Tested with Sublime Text 3, build 3114.
```

## Contributing
Contributions are highly valued, welcomed and appreciated whether it is just to file an Issue, or to even make a Pull Request. This is my first Sublime Text plugin as well as my first time using Python in a long time.
